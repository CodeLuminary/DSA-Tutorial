Array = [1,2,3,6,8,9] O(n)

LinkedList - Single and double LinkedList

data1 <-> data2 <->data6 <-> data3 <-> data4

            data1
            /   \
        data2   data3

trie, graph 

PROPERTIES OF BINARY
1.) A binary tree must have only one root
2.) Must have at most two children
3.) Must have only one path from root node to any node.

            data1
            /   \
        data2 -> data3

USE CASES
Use in AI
Huffain uses binary tree for data compression
SQL database uses B-tree for storing indexes(Primary keys)
Routers uses binary tree for packet tracing
Binary tree for sorting
A sorted binary tree is a binary tree in which the left child is less than the parent node
and the right node is greater than the parent node.

For Arrays, you loop
The word traverse is used for traverse

HOW TO TRAVERSE A tree
1.) Depth First Search uses stack. Stack is LIFO
2.) Breadth First Search uses queues. Queues if FIFO
